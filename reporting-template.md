# Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately either in-person or via
the information below. Conference staff can be identified by their STAFF t-shirts. Conference staff
will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide
escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe.

We recommend you use the following template to report any incident:

## Reporter

## The behavior that was in violation
